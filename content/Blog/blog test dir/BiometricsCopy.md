###### Biometrics
- The concept of using part of your physical self to authenticate to the system.
###### Fingerprint
- A fingerprint scanner scans your fingerprint and compares it with the system-stored fingerprint you previously submitted during enrollment (described in the next section). A similar system is a palm scanner.

###### Retina
- A retinal scanner scans the pattern of blood vessels around the retina of your eye and compares it with the system-stored image.
- Checks eye blood vessels.

###### Iris
- An iris scanner scans the colored part of your eye that surrounds the pupil and compares it with the system-stored image.
- Checks eye color.

###### Facial
- Facial recognition authenticates the user based on points of reference on the face.

###### Voice
- A voice-recognition system requires you to speak, and it verifies your voice pattern based on the system-stored sample you previously submitted.

###### Vein
- Vein recognition, also known as vascular recognition, involves analyzing the pattern of blood vessels as seen through the personâ€™s skin.
###### Gait analysis
- Analyzes the body movements of an individual as a method of identifying them. Gait analysis typically analyzes the stride of an individual when walking or running.

###### Efficacy rates
- how effective the system is at doing its job at giving satisfactory results.
- When evaluating biometric systems, it is important to understand the *efficacy rates* and the *error rates*.
###### FAR (False acceptance)
- **Type I:** A type I error is known as the ***False rejection rate (FRR)*** and occurs when the biometric system fails to authenticate someone who is authorized to access the system.
###### FRR (False rejection)
- ***Type II:*** A type II error is the opposite of a type I error in that it allows someone to access the system who is not authorized to access the system. This type of error is known as the ***false acceptance rate (FAR)***.
###### Crossover Error Rate (CER)
- A number representing when the number of type I errors equals the number of type II errors. 
> For example, if 5 out of 100 authentication attempts are type I errors and 5 out of 100 authentication attempts are type II errors, then the CER is 5. The lower the CER value, the more accurate the biometric system is.
