### My Thoughts on SOC 2

For the past 10 months, I’ve been working as an intern at an auditing firm, focusing on SOC audits, both Type 1 and Type 2. My role primarily involves preparing these audits, and through this experience, I’ve gained a comprehensive understanding of the differences between these types. SOC 1 audits assess a system's control at a specific point in time, while SOC 2 audits evaluate the effectiveness of those controls over a period of time. This distinction has been fundamental in shaping my understanding of audit processes and their implications for businesses.

One of the most valuable skills I've developed is mastering my "auditor voice." This involves crafting formal, professional writing that conveys complex information clearly and effectively. Learning to communicate with clients has been equally important. Gathering the right evidence for our reports is crucial, and knowing when to request additional information is an essential part of the process. This has taught me the importance of precision and clarity in professional communication.

I've also delved deeply into sampling methodology, which is critical in ensuring that our audits are representative and accurate. Understanding how to sample populations for corporations of various sizes has been an enlightening experience. It has given me a new perspective on how data can be systematically and fairly analyzed to draw meaningful conclusions.

My exposure to different cloud environments has been particularly eye-opening. I’ve learned how companies configure these systems and the importance of robust security measures in protecting sensitive information. This knowledge is invaluable in today's digital age, where cloud computing plays a central role in business operations.

Additionally, I’ve gained insights into general business operations, including organizational structures and workflows. This broader understanding of how businesses function has complemented my technical knowledge and provided a well-rounded view of the corporate world. Seeing how different departments interact and support each other has been fascinating and has deepened my appreciation for the complexities of business management.

As a cybersecurity major with experience in multiple Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, I have a particular interest in penetration test reports. These reports offer a fascinating glimpse into real-world red-teaming and ethical hacking, aligning with my academic and professional interests. They bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, providing a window into the dynamic world of cybersecurity threats and defenses.

Communication in the workplace has proven to be crucial. Whether it’s collaborating with colleagues or interfacing with clients, effective communication underpins every successful project. I’ve strived to improve my skills continuously, recognizing that clear and concise communication is key to achieving our objectives and maintaining professional relationships.

This role marks my first significant position in the business world, and it has been a steep learning curve. However, I’m committed to ongoing learning and improvement. My journey in the auditing field has been enlightening, and I am eager to explore Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) and other areas of cybersecurity further. Each day brings new challenges and learning opportunities, and I look forward to continuing to grow in this dynamic and ever-evolving field.
